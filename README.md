# Deadrift
This was the newest version of the game that I was able to find from my team's development of Deadrift over 3 months.

P.S. First level does not have any direction for presentation purposes so that the player wouldn't die when we detailed the game.
To fix, run to door and press 'E' to enter the second room!
